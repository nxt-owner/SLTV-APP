# SLTV - Streaming for Learning and Awareness

SLTV is an experimental and non-commercial mobile application built by an independent developer with the goal of:

- Assisting people who cannot afford expensive entertainment or educational resources
- Exploring IPTV technology for personal learning and open research
- Promoting digital literacy and media access in low-income communities

## 📚 Purpose

This project is created strictly for **educational**, **research**, and **personal use** only.  
It is **not intended for commercial distribution, monetization, or public promotion**.

## 📡 Content Sources

SLTV displays internet-based live stream links (HLS `.m3u8`), some of which are found from publicly available sources such as GitHub repositories, open forums, or educational websites.

> ⚠️ The developer **does not host**, own, or guarantee the legality of these external links.  
> The content is streamed directly from third-party servers.

## 🔄 Takedown Requests

I will remove or disable the links **immediately** upon verified request — no legal escalation needed.
